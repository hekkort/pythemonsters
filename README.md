# PokÃ©mon style turn and text based battler

This project requires uv, install uv: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

## Interface

Activate venv -> source ./venv.sh.
Install requirements -> uv add -r requirements.txt.
Type ./main.sh and you'll see the interface which will prompt you for an attack, one through four.

## Roadmap

Add type to moves (Done)
Add super effective (Done)
Add not very effective (Done)
Maybe status effects as well

## So far

Very basic logic for moves that have power implemented so far. Will probably pick this up again down the road but I consider it done for now.
