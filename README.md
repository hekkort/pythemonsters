# PokÃ©mon style turn and text based battler

This project requires uv, install uv: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

## Interface

### Optional:

- nano ~/.bashrc (on linux)
- scroll to the bottom
- add alias venv='source ./venv.sh'
- add alias main='./main.sh'
- activate venv: venv
- run the game: main

### Or otherwise:

Activate venv -> source ./venv.sh.
Install requirements -> uv add -r requirements.txt.
Type ./main.sh and you'll see the interface which will prompt you for an attack, one through four.

## Roadmap

Add type to moves (Done)
Add super effective (Done)
Add not very effective (Done)
Maybe status effects as well

## So far

Implementing all the logic for a proper pokemon battle is a lot of work so for now I consider this barebones version done.
I will probably pick this up down the road again to implement more.
